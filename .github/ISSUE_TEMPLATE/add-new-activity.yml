        ## For Development Team
        
        **Technical Implementation Notes:**
        - Add new activity entry to `src/backend/database.py` in the `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Ensure schedule_details format matches existing activities (24-hour time format)
        - Activity will be automatically categorized by frontend based on name/description keywords
        - Test teacher authentication and student registration functionality
        
        **Files to modify:**
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Add activity data
        - Potentially `src/static/app.js` - If new activity type categorization needed
